### Project 2 - Tofu Warriors
Tofu Warriors is a search engine and collaborative forum for gourmet recipes. Users are able to securely login and then search, create, edit, and clone recipes. Recipes are available to users from either the 3rd party API or from user-created recipes stored in our database. The comment section allows for users to express their opinions on recipes that they tried, suggest improvements on recipes, and interact with other foodies by responding directly to their comments. Each recipe has an ingredient list, instructions on how to prepare the meal, and a list of tags to describe what kind of recipe it is. This application challenges users' culinary creativity and provides them with the information and community to be able to create amazing meals.
